Aircraft Maintenance Manual Chatbot The objective of this project is to build an interactive chatbot that can use a PDF of an aircraft maintenance manual to reply to inquiries. The chatbot answers user questions and locates relevant content in the handbook by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including question-answering models and embedding-based search.

Qualities Automated text extraction from an uploaded PDF aircraft maintenance manual is known as PDF parsing. Embedding-Based Search: This method saves text passages in an FAISS vector index for efficient similarity searches after encoding them with a SentenceTransformer model. Question-Answering: By using the "question-answering" pipeline created by Hugging Face, it is possible to reply to user questions by using relevant context found inside the document. Using an interactive chatbot's easy-to-use interface, ask questions and receive answers based on the airline handbook.
